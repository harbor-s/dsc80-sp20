    "    - You should try to assess your answer to each question based on what you understand of the data. This might involve writing extensive code (that isn't turned in) just to check your work! Suggestions on checking your work are given in the assignment, but you should also think of your own ways of checking your work.\n",
    "    - As you do this project, think about the data from the perspective of the student (which should be easy to do!)"
